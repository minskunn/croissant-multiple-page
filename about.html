    <h1>About croissants</h1>
    <p>
      The croissant's history is as rich and layered as its flaky pastry.
      Originating in Austria, not France as commonly believed, its creation is
      often credited to the bakers of Vienna. The croissant's precursor, the
      kipferl, was a crescent-shaped pastry enjoyed since at least the 13th
      century.
