      Making croissants requires time, patience, and attention to detail, but
      the process can be incredibly rewarding. Here's a simplified version of a
      traditional croissant recipe:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>500g (4 cups) all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>10g (2 tsp) salt</li>
      <li>60g (1/4 cup) granulated sugar</li>
      <li>10g (3 tsp) instant yeast</li>
      <li>250ml (1 cup) warm milk</li>
      <li>250g (1 cup) cold unsalted butter, for laminating</li>
      <li>1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Instructions: Mix the dough. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour,
      salt, sugar, and instant yeast. Make a well in the center and pour in the
      warm milk. Mix until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface
      for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Shape the
      dough: Shape the dough into a ball and place it in a lightly oiled bowl.
      Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2
      hours, or until doubled in size. Laminate the dough: Roll out the cold
      butter between two sheets of parchment paper into a rectangle, about 1/2
      inch thick. Place the butter slab in the center of the rolled-out dough.
      Fold the dough over the butter, sealing the edges tightly. Roll out the
      dough into a rectangle again and fold it into thirds like a letter. Wrap
      it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Repeat the folding
      process: Remove the dough from the refrigerator and repeat the rolling and
      folding process (known as "turns") two more times, chilling the dough for
      30 minutes between each turn. Shape the croissants: After the final turn,
      roll out the dough into a large rectangle, about 1/4 inch thick. Cut the
      dough into triangles. Roll each triangle tightly from the wide end to the
      tip, shaping it into a crescent. Place the shaped croissants on a baking
      sheet lined with parchment paper. Proof the croissants: Cover the shaped
      croissants with a clean kitchen towel and let them proof in a warm place
      for 1-2 hours, or until they double in size. Bake the croissants: Preheat
      the oven to 200¬∞C (400¬∞F). Brush the proofed croissants with beaten egg
      for a shiny finish. Bake them in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or
      until they are golden brown and puffed up. Enjoy: Let the croissants cool
      slightly before serving.
